# Credit Risk Analysis – Loan Approvals

## Project Overview
This project analyzes loan application data to identify factors influencing loan approval decisions. The analysis focuses on credit score, income, employment tenure, loan amount, and geographic trends.

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets (data cleaning, pivot analysis, dashboard)
- Google BigQuery (SQL analysis)
- GitHub (project documentation)

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following fields:
- Applicant Name
- City
- Annual Income
- Credit Score
- Loan Amount
- Years Employed
- Loan Approval Status

## Analysis Performed
- Approval rates by credit score band
- Approval rates by employment tenure
- Average loan amount by approval status
- Denial trends by city
- Risk level comparison across applicants

## Key Insights
- Higher credit scores and longer employment history strongly correlate with loan approval.
- Loan denials increase when loan amounts are disproportionate to income.
- Certain cities show higher denial concentrations, indicating geographic risk patterns.

## Next Steps
- Expand analysis using larger datasets
- Automate reporting using SQL views
- Add additional risk metrics
